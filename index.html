        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p>
          Eleanor Turino began her career in education as a reading and social studies teacher for fifth and sixth graders in Ocean Hill-Brownsville in Brooklyn, New York. After working as a children's librarian at a public library, Eleanor was a School Library Media Specialist who taught in an elementary school for twenty years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Needless to say, childrenâ€™s literature was an integral and beloved part of her curriculum. Her experiences working in education left an imprint, so she decided to make her first foray into publishing with <cite><em>Pick Me</em></cite>. With Maurice's first adventure, he experiences the magic of being read aloud. More of his adventures will be explored in future books.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eleanor currently resides in New York with her husband, and has been known to quote literary lines not from Shakespeare but from Margaret Wise Brown.
        </p>

          I hope you enjoy my book. I hope you <cite>Pick Me</cite>!
