          Maurice, a library book that has never been read aloud, yearns to be picked even though he knows the dangers associated with leaving the comfort of his library shelf. Will it be the best of times, or the worst of times?

        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p>
          Eleanor Turino began her career in education as a reading and social studies teacher for fifth and sixth graders at Ocean Hill-Brownsville in Brooklyn, New York. After working as a children's librarian at a public library, Eleanor was a School Library Media Specialist who taught in an elementary school for twenty years. Needless to say, childrenâ€™s literature was an integral and beloved part of her curriculum. Her experiences working in education left an imprint, so she decided to make her first foray into publishing with <cite>The Adventures of Maurice the Book</cite>. With Maurice's first adventure, the goal is to address the joys of reading and create a picture book that gives life to inanimate objects. In <cite>Pick Me!</cite>, Maurice experiences the magic of being read aloud, and more of his adventures will be explored in future books.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eleanor currently resides in New York with her husband, and has been known to quote literary lines not from Shakespeare but from Margaret Wise Brown.
